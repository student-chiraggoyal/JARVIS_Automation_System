# 🤖 Jarvis Automation System — Python-Based Voice Assistant

Welcome to my first **Python voice automation project** — a simple, beginner-level **Jarvis Automation System**. Built entirely using **Python and its speech libraries**, this project aims to automate basic desktop tasks using **voice commands** like:

> “Hey Jarvis, open YouTube”  
> “Hey Jarvis, play music”  
> “Hey Jarvis, open Spotify”

This project was developed as a part of my Python learning journey to explore real-world use cases of **speech recognition**, **text-to-speech conversion**, and **basic browser/app automation**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand how Python can be used for **voice-controlled automation**
- Explore key Python libraries for building a **basic AI assistant**
- Apply learning from Python basics (functions, classes, modules, etc.)
- Prepare a base project for future integration with **APIs like ChatGPT**

## 🚀 Features Implemented

| Feature                        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🎙️ Voice Recognition          | Listens to your commands via the microphone using `speech_recognition`     |
| 🗣️ Text-to-Speech Engine      | Responds via speech using `pyttsx3`                                         |
| 🌐 Web Automation             | Opens websites like YouTube, Spotify using `webbrowser`                    |
| 🎵 Music Playback             | Plays predefined songs using a local `musicLibrary` (custom module)        |
| ⚙️ Predefined Commands Only   | Works only with manually defined apps/commands in the code                 |

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- `speech_recognition` – for capturing voice commands  
- `pyttsx3` – for text-to-speech conversion  
- `webbrowser` – to open websites on the default browser  
- `musicLibrary` – (custom module for basic music playback)  

> 📌 Note: Make sure all required libraries are installed using `pip install` commands. The `musicLibrary` module is custom-made and included in the project folder.

---

## 📦 How It Works

1. The assistant runs in the background and waits for your voice input.
2. Once it recognizes the command (like “Hey Jarvis, open YouTube”), it:
   - Identifies the trigger word (e.g., "open", "play")
   - Matches the request with the predefined applications/websites
   - Executes the command using `webbrowser` or custom logic
3. It responds with a voice (via `pyttsx3`) confirming the action.

## 📁 Folder Structure

📦 jarvis-automation/ ├── 🎙️ main.py # Main script to run the assistant ├── 🎵 musicLibrary.py # Custom module to play songs ├── 📄 requirements.txt # Python dependencies ├── 📝 README.md # You're here!

## 📌 Limitations (Current Stage)

- Only opens **manually defined applications/websites**
- Does **not use APIs** (yet) for intelligent responses
- No support for dynamic or complex commands
- Runs in a local environment with basic error handling

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- ✅ Integrate **ChatGPT API** for natural language understanding
- ✅ Add **custom APIs** for weather, news, and more
- ✅ Enable **dynamic application recognition**
- ✅ Implement **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**
- ✅ Use a **wake-word engine** like Snowboy for continuous listening
- ✅ Improve voice command parsing with **NLP**
